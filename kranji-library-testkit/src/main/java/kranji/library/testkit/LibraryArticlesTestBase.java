/**
 * Every article of the trees a subclass names actually reads - one test case
 * per article.
 *
 * <h2>The failure this exists to stop</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link kranji.reading.content.ArticleParser} already finds everything an
 * author can get wrong - a character the corpus cannot read, an override that
 * is not one of that character's readings, a brace left open. The catalogue
 * tests check that a resource <em>exists</em>; whether the text inside it can
 * be served was, before this existed, discovered by a child clicking the title
 * and getting "did not parse". That is the worst shape a content bug can have:
 * invisible to the author, invisible to review, invisible to the build, and it
 * arrives as a blank pane in front of the reader.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why one case per article</h2>
 *
 * <p>A single method looping over five hundred articles reports "1 test, 1
 * failure" and puts the damage inside an assertion message. Parameterised, the
 * count is the size of the library, a broken poem is named by the failure
 * rather than buried in it, and a run says which shelf is unhealthy at a
 * glance. The case is named by the article's address, so the report reads as a
 * list of addresses rather than of indices.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Why a base class per group rather than one test over everything</h2>
 *
 * <p>A group is the unit of authorship, and it is where an author is working
 * when the check fails. Running it in the group module means the failure
 * arrives from the module being edited, in the second that module takes,
 * rather than from the application at the end of the reactor. The
 * application-level subclass is still worth having and is not a duplicate: it
 * is the only place where every root on one classpath is asked at once, which
 * is the arrangement a reader actually gets.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Errors gate; warnings are reported</h2>
 *
 * <p>An error means the article cannot be served, so it fails the build.</p>
 *
 * <p>A warning means a judgement was made on the author's behalf - nearly
 * always "this character has more than one reading and I used the principal".
 * There are thousands, because the commonest characters are polyphonic and
 * appear in every sentence ever written. Gating on them would mean overriding
 * the corpus into agreeing with itself, so they are written to
 * {@link #report()} instead, where an author can find their own article and
 * check the readings that were guessed for it.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Extending it</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 * class ArticlesTest extends LibraryArticlesTestBase {
 *     protected List&lt;LibraryTree&gt; trees() { return List.of(ShiCiLibrary.TREE); }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The members here are {@code protected} rather than package-private on
 * purpose: a subclass lives in its own group's package, and JUnit does not
 * inherit a package-private method across a package boundary. It would find no
 * tests and report success, which is the one failure mode a test framework
 * must not have.</p>
